#+AUTHOR: dragon

* Preface
  All testing done on two =ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server= VMs under the same host.
  Both VMs have ssh enabled with =ufw= and keys exchanged with =ssh-copy-id=.
  Both VMs have added the other's IP (found with =ifconfig=) to their =/etc/hosts= file with an alias for easier readability.
  
* Ansible
  Ansible has three directories:
  - ad_hoc
  - playbooks
  - roles
